:snowflake: Are you ready to spend Spring Break on the slopes, building sick ramps to save your mountainside ski town from a daily (and sadly unavoidable) avalanche? :snowflake:

This **physics-based 3D-hybrid destruction simulator** lets you divert the flow of snow to preserve and/or destroy trees, buildings, and even bystanders! :house: :helicopter:

Try to hold it off for as long as you can, but in the end, the fate of this town can't be stopped - **you're only delaying the inevitable!**
